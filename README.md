#Badger

Because I grow weary of copy-n-pasting the badge URLs into the README of every project, and the [b.adge.me](http://b.adge.me) API now supports all of the services I use

##Usage

Add it to your Gemfile

    gem 'badger', :github => 'pikesley/badger'
    bundle
    
Then
 
    badger badge
    [![Build Status](http://b.adge.me/travis/pikesley/badger.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pikesley/badger)
    [![Coverage Status](http://b.adge.me/coveralls/pikesley/badger.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/pikesley/badger)
    [![Dependency Status](http://b.adge.me/gemnasium/pikesley/badger.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/pikesley/badger)
    [![Code Climate](http://b.adge.me/codeclimate/github/pikesley/badger.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/pikesley/badger)
    
ready to paste into the top of your README (with the correct URLs for your repo (hopefully)).

##Help me make it better

because it's currently all kinds of broken:

    âž” badger badge
    /Users/sam/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0@global/gems/bundler-1.5.0/lib/bundler/definition.rb:390:in `validate_ruby!': Your Ruby version is 1.8.7, but your Gemfile specified 2.1.0 (Bundler::RubyVersionMismatch)

WTFF?

So yeah, please:

    git clone https://github.com/pikesley/badger
    cd badger
    bundle
    rake
